# BMI Calculator

Welcome to the BMI Calculator Flutter project! This project is designed to help you create a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator app using the Flutter framework.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will be asked to create a mobile app that takes in a user's height and weight, calculates their BMI, and then categorizes their BMI based on the standard BMI ranges. You will also create a filter that will only allow valid input for the height and weight.
